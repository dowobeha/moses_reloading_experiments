# Phrase tables
Static PT
Dynamic PT

# Language models
Static LM
Dynamic LM

# Goal
Change dynamic LM with translations from two source 
languages to effect different translation.

# Status
Much implemented here, but no successful run.
It was decided to create a new directory for 
multiple static LMs and static PTs rather than 
retroactively modify directories 006 and 010.  
Directory 011 is built from 006 and 010 and it 
is intended to be run with run3.sh, which expects 
a single working dir with moses.ini files for 
the static and dynamic moses servers of two
source langs.  It also expects a static PT for 
each source lang.
