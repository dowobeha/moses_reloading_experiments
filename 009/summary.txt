# Phrase tables
Static PT
Dynamic PT

# Language models
Static LM

# Goal
Build on the use of dynamic PT in 007:
      In initializing the dynamic PT from the static PT,
      the dynamic is edited to try to get moses to output
      a different translation -- 
      i.e. "chat" translated as "kitty" instead of "cat".

# Status
Success.
