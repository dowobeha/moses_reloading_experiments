# Goal
Use Moses flag to signal OOV item in translation and 
assign minimal prob mass (-90) to OOV when added to PT.

# Status
Success.
Moses has been initialized in run3.sh with the -drop-unknown option, 
such that in topts, the target-phrase != source-phrase; instead, 
the target-phrase == "" for unknown words.  Therefore, when a 
source-phrase is found whose target-phrase is the empty sting, 
that source-phrase is added to a list of OOV.  That list is then 
handled by the handleOOV method, which assigns scores of -90 to each 
OOV of language A for which a translation is found in language B.
