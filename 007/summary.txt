# Phrase tables
Static PT

# Language models
Static LM

# Goal
Build on 004 and 005 to first gather all translation options, 
      and then call a second instance of mosesserver using a Dynamic PT,
      thus attempting to recreate (for later use in a dynamic PT) the result of the static PT

# Status
Success.

Added new functionality to Moses (Moses commit 999d6b6371437862e9309c5bcfe5ccf78a9782ab)
This new functionality exposes labelled translation option scores via XML-RPC.

Added new functionality to Moses (Moses commit a18b6676b1aecd60973d1a4a81abc995ba1b9fe0)
This new functionality enables the user to specify in the Moses config file
     whether or not the values associated with phrase table entries in PhraseDictionaryMemoryPerSentenceOnDemand
     are probability values.

This turns out to be important. The code in PhraseDictionaryMemoryPerSentenceOnDemand was taking the log of incoming values.
If this has already been done (in the client code) then you end up with NaN values some of the time, 
   which in turn results in those on-demand phrase tables entries not being used.

More importantly, some of the time we might want on-demand phrase table entries to have scores that are positive values, which we can't do if we take the log.
