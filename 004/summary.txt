# Phrase tables
Static PT

# Language models
Static LM

# Goal
Use XML-RPC to get access to the original Moses translation options for a given sentence.


# Rationale
In the previous attempt (003), modifying the weights didn't seem to work.
I don't know if this is because of averaging or because of something else.
But modifying the pt values directly did work (002).

So, if we can get the pt translation options, then the client.py can modify the accompanying scores directly.
This would make modifying the weights unnecessary.

If that works, then we could run two instances of moses server.
The first instance would simply use a static PT and static LM.
The second instance would not use a static PT,
    but instead would simply use a single on-demand PT 
    (and probably a single static LM, although in principle a dynamic LM could be used instead or as well)
The scores within the dynamic PT could be changed on the fly by the client.py,
    presumably making desired (positive) PT entries's scores become more positive
    and making undesired (negative) PT entries's scores become more negative
