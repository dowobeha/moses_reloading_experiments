# Phrase tables
Static PT

# Language models
Static LM

# Goal
Build on 004 and 005 to first gather all translation options, 
      and then call a second instance of mosesserver using a Dynamic PT,
      thus attempting to recreate (for later use in a dynamic PT) the result of the static PT

# Status
Success.

Added new functionality to Moses (Moses commit 999d6b6371437862e9309c5bcfe5ccf78a9782ab)
This new functionality exposes labelled translation option scores via XML-RPC.
